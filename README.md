These data and codes are from the 2025 publication: The effects of imidacloprid and polyester microfibers on the larval development of the endangered Sunflower Star. 
Files:
brachnew: rantings based on development level of brachiolar features (rudiment, arms, adhesive disk, and radial canal)
coelom: raw data marking which larvae had fully fused coelom or not, with treatment codes (I=imidacloprid, M=microfibers)
coelompercent: above coelom data organized as counts and percentages 
countstats: surviorship data showing counts out of total from previous sample date
lengthspooled: larval lengths, these were pooled by replicate to reduce noise from natural variance in each replicate
settlepercent: percent of total larvae that had settled in each treatment
